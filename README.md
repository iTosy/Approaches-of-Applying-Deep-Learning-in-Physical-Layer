# Approaches of Applying Deep Learning in Physical Layer

## Introduction

In this project I try some algorithm used for the communication process in physical layer, construct a neural network autoencoder to replace the algorithmic processes, and finally construct a residual binarized neural network software for the model.

## Content

* Modulation constellation points and noise effect
* Modulation with and without encoding and Block Error Ratio for different SNR
* A comparison between Autoencoder and Reed Solomon encoding algorithm
* The residual Binarized Neurak Network Autoencoder

## Libraries

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Pyitpp
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Usage

* Importing pyitpp <br/>
  pyitpp is a pybind library of the itpp library for C++. <br/>
  The python version (pyitpp) doesn't have Reed Solomon encoding, so for be able to use Reed solomon you should follow these instruction: <br/>
